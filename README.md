This project demonstrates the integration of multiple functionalities within a single application. Built with **Next.js**, it seamlessly combines various features and leverages external APIs, such as **GEMINI AI**, to provide robust solutions like text-to-text generation.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:  
   Users can sign up or log in using their GitHub credentials.

2. **Dashboard Access**:  
   A centralized dashboard where users can explore and utilize services, such as:  
   - **Blog Creation**  
   - **Script Generation**  
   - **Code Generation**

3. **Service Functionality**:  
   Each service includes input fields tailored to specific content types, generating outputs based on user-provided input.

4. **Credits System**:  
   Users are allocated **10,000 credits** by default. Upon reaching this limit, they are prompted to upgrade their plan to continue using the services.
